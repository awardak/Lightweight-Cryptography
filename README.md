# Lightweight-Cryptography

This project contains my attempts at implementing and measuring the performace of cryptographic algorithms on resource constrained devices, specifically the [Arduino Uno Rev 3](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno) which has an 8-bit, 16 MHz microcontroller and only 2KB of [SRAM](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Memory).

The sketch_* folders have the sketch files that are used to load onto the Arduino.
